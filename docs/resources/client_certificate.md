# qrator_client_certificate (Resource)

Manages client certificates in Qrator. Supports `upload` and `letsencrypt` certificate types.

## Example Usage

### Upload Certificate

```terraform
resource "qrator_client_certificate" "upload" {
  client_id = 12345
  type      = "upload"

  certificates {
    cert = file("cert.pem")
    key  = file("key.pem")
  }
}
```

### Let's Encrypt Certificate

```terraform
resource "qrator_client_certificate" "letsencrypt" {
  client_id = 12345
  type      = "letsencrypt"
  domain_id = 12345
  hostnames = ["example.com", "www.example.com"]
}
```

## Import

Certificates can be imported using the format `client_id/certificate_id`:

```shell
terraform import qrator_client_certificate.example 12345/67890
```

Where `12345` is the client ID and `67890` is the certificate ID.

~> **Note:** Sensitive fields (`cert`, `key`) will not be populated after import — they are write-only. Subsequent plans may show a diff for these fields if they are specified in the configuration.
